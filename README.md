An Angular2 app that takes information in a form about a movie or TV show and outputs it in a list with the information entered. 
This was an exercise in the basics of Angular 2 including component creation and deletion, routing, services, Http requests, custom directives, and custom pipes. The current version retrieves a set of default display items using Http to fetch them from a local file named mock-xhr-backend that simulates the response of a server.
